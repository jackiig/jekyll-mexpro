                    <h2 class="center">We made Mexico insurance online a thing!</h2>
                    <p>We created Mexpro because we wanted to be able to purchase Mexico insurance online, before heading to Mexico ourselves. We also saw the need to provide a product you could trust and count on when visiting a foreign country.</p>
                    <p>Since we were already in the insurance industry, it was easy for us to understand the differences between US and Mexico insurance and take steps to be sure your experience was easy.</p>
                    <p>Since 1999, we have built strong relationships with the top Mexico insurers, and have created options previously not available, like English speaking adjusters and claims agents. We only work with Mexican companies who are rated for their history and ability to pay claims and treat their customers well.</p>
                    <p>The Mexico insurance Pros (Mexpro) are here to make your insurance experience the best it can be, whether you buy online, by phone or when making a claim. <strong>We've got you covered!</strong></p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Jim and Andrea Labelle began Mexpro in their basement beginning in 1999. Jim was essentially born into the insurance industry, as his father owned a prominent business in Scottsdale, Arizona. He had a strong understanding of the need for being insured with a quality [A-rated] insurance company when an accident occurs.</p>
            <p>Andrea, always on the cutting edge of things, knew the internet was taking off and offering the quality product Jim conceptualized, online was what they needed to do. Jim's experience and Andrea's drive got them appointments with Mexico's top insurance companies. Before long, those companies were serving Mexpro's customers (now over 1 million) with bilingual policies, claims personnel and adjusters. As well as, the best quality coverage, and online.</p>

                    <h2 class="center">Why Mexico Insurance</h2>
                    <p>Mexico liability insurance has always been required by law, but when Mexpro was founded, few visitors who traveled by car to Mexico knew this. If they did, they bought from small Mom &amp; Pop agencies near the border. There was little guarantee that agents who sold these policies would submit your policy to the insurer, unless there was a claim. That meant, in the event of an accident, there could be big headaches in trying to get help from and submit claims to your Mexican insurance company.</p>
                    <p>Today, with Mexpro you can print your policy online before you leave, knowing you are insured with the best coverage available. If you do get into an accident you can call the 800 number on your policy, speak to a customer service agent in English, have a bilingual adjuster sent right away to the scene of the accident to help you file your claim and get you back to vacationing.</p>

                              <span>We purchased insurance from you for a recent Mexico trip, including Mex-Visit travel assist. When our car broke down I called the 800 number and a tow truck was called for us, which came in about an hour. The driver took us to a great mechanic who fixed the problem immediately, at a very reasonable price. Less than four hours after breaking down, we were back on the road and continued safely to our destination. I don't know what we would have done without your assistance. Thank-you. The insurance representative was very helpful &amp;reassuring at a time when I was nervous about being stranded.</span><br>
