                        <h3> 1. Earthquake and Volcanic Eruption Coverage</h3>
                        <p>Damages due to earthquake and volcano eruption are subject to a peril specific deductible and coinsurance amounts that vary by the insureds location.</p>
                        <p>The closer the home is to the danger, the higher the percentage amount, and the greater the insured’s out of pocket responsibility. Catastrophic deductibles start as low as 1% and can be as high as 5%. Coinsurance amounts vary from between 10% and 20%.</p>
                        <p>The deductible is based on a percentage of the insured amount, while the coinsurance is based on a percentage of the amount of a loss.</p>

                        <h3>2.  Hydro Meteorological Coverage</h3>
                        <p>Hydro-meteorological coverage refers to damage caused by hurricane, wind, hail, flood and tidal wave. Like earthquake and volcanic coverage, peril specific deductibles and coinsurance amounts vary by location.</p>
                        <p>A good example is Rocky Point versus Cabo San Lucas: Rocky Point has a 1% deductible for Hydro Meteorological coverage, while Cabo San Lucas has a 5% deductible for the same coverage. This is because Cabo is far more likely to experience extensive hurricane damage.</p>
