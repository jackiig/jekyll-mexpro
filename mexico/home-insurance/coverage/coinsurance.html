                    <p>Coinsurance is the insured’s percentage share of responsibility for the expense of a loss. Coinsurance percentage amounts are calculated using the amount of a loss, while the deductible percentage amounts are based on the total amount insured.

                    <p class="center">Let’s say your home is insured for $250,000, with 10% coinsurance, and a 2% deductible.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><p>First, the Deductible is calculated using the insured amount.<br>Insured amount, multiplied by the deductible percentage, equals the deductible amount:<br>$250,000 x 2% = $5,000</p></li>

                        <li><p>Next, the Deductible amount to be paid by the insured is subtracted from the loss amount.<br>Loss amount, minus deductible amount, equals remaining loss amount:<br>$100,000 - $5,000 = $95,000</p></li>

                        <li><p>Finally, the coinsurance is calculated using the remaining loss amount.<br>Remaining loss amount, multiplied by coinsurance percentage, equals coinsurance amount:<br>$95,000 x 10% = $9,500</p></li>
                        </ol>

                        <p class="center">The insured’s out of pocket expense would be the deductible amount plus the coinsurance amount.<br><strong>$5000 + $9,500 =  $14,500.</strong></p>
