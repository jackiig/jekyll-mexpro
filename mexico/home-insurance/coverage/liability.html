                    <p>Jewelry and fine art items are covered, with values up to $1,000 USD each. For high value items over $1,000 USD, a special coverage endorsement must be approved by the policy underwriters, and an additional premium needs to be paid by the insured. Submitting a <a href="https://help.mexpro.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=558727" title="endorsement request">special request to the underwriters</a> is easy with our online application.</p>
                    <p>To keep the cost of coverage down, most people do not insure each and every one of their possessions against theft, but instead just the items that they feel would more likely be stolen if a break in occurred. Since burglars tend to target higher value items like electronics, jewelry, appliances, etc., this is what most people tend to insure against theft.</p>
