                    <p>Mexpro’s GNP Mexico homeowner’s insurance policy includes replacement value coverage for your home and your personal belongings. Replacement coverage can reimburse you for the cost to rebuild your primary dwelling and other structures, up to the insured amount, minus the deductible. And when applicable, minus the coinsurance amount.</p>
                    <p>When shopping around for Mexico homeowner’s insurance, be sure to avoid policies that only offer actual cash value coverage. The amount paid out after a claim could be reduced drastically due to depreciation. With replacement value coverage, you don’t have to worry about depreciation. </p>
