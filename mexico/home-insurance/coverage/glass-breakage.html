                    <h2>Maximum/Minimum Limits</h2>
                    <p>The minimum limit for glass breakage coverage is $1000 USD, and the maximum is $95,000 USD.</p>
                    <p>To calculate the amount of glass breakage coverage needed for your home, condo, or townhome, you’ll want to consider the cost of replacing all of the glass, on the outside, as well as the inside, of your home.</p>
                    <p>We recommend your limit of coverage for glass breakage be based on the cost to replace all of your glass. This ensures your policy will provide sufficient coverage, even in the worst-case scenario where everything made of glass gets broken at once.</p>

                        <p>The available deductibles for glass breakage coverage start as low as $500 USD and can be adjusted up to $20,000 USD. We recommend choosing the $500 deductible, to make the glass breakage coverage more useful, by keeping your out of pocket expense as low as possible.</p>
                        <p>The policy excludes theft coverage for solar panels. However, battery banks, power inverters, electrical wiring, and other equipment, typically used in a solar powered home setups, are all typically still eligible for theft coverage.</p>
